              The Gift of Chess is a nonprofit organization dedicated to using
              chess as a tool for education, personal development, and social
              transformation. Since our inception, we have worked with schools,
              children's homes, prisons, and refugee communities across Kenya
              to nurture talent, build critical thinking, and provide safe,
              constructive spaces where children and youth can grow and
              thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Kenya, we have also integrated an environmental sustainability
              component into our work. In partnership with Kijiji Solutions, we
              recycle plastic waste to produce chess sets, turning waste into
              meaningful tools that expand access to chess while contributing to
              climate action.
